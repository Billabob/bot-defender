		<p style="text-align: center; padding-left: 300px; padding-right: 300px;">In the Discord server you can report trade botters who aren't on the list, ask for yourself to be removed off the list (if you were errantly added), report bugs to the developers, make suggestions for updates, or simply chat.</p>

		<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 16.38px;"><em>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</em></span></h3>
		<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">The extension doesn't work, what am I supposed to do?</span></h3>
		<p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px;">There are a variety of things that could be causing the extension not to run. First try to restart the extension from chrome://extensions. It may take a few minutes to register for the extension to start running and declining trades. <br><br>If that doesn't solve the problem, click on the extension's icon to bring up the page with an on-off switch (that you had to click to open this info page). If the switch is bright red and says "OFF", click it to turn on Bot Defender. If it's still not working, join our Discord server and tell us what's wrong.</p>
		
		<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Where can I see the code behind the extension?</span></h3>
		<p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px;">The code can be seen by inspecting the extension in chrome://extensions/ or it can be seen, and contributed to, on the GitHub page: <a style="color: #00ccff;" href="https://github.com/codetariat/bot-defender/">https://github.com/codetariat/bot-defender/</a></p>

		<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Can this extension decline trades when my computer is turned off, or when Chrome is closed?</span></h3>
		<p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px;">No, this extension, just like Chrome extensions in general, runs on your Chrome browser so you must have Chrome open for it to function. However you don't need a Roblox tab open.</p>
		<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Can't I just set my trades to followers only?</span></h3>
		<p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px;">Yes, this will block most bots. But it also reduces the amount of legitimate trades you receive, thanks to the added effort it takes to send you a trade, let alone if they are affected by the strict ratelimit on following, or subjected to solving captchas. Many users will stop bothering if they see that your trades are closed, my experiments showed that I receive around 40% less trades than when they're completely open (excluding bots of course). You'll also be affected by this as you'll have to follow users every single time you send a trade, which often leads to hitting Roblox's rate limits.</p>
		<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">I'm on the list but I'm not a bot?</span></h3>
		<p id="stat" style="text-align: center;">There are x known bot accounts and while we try our best to carefully investigate every user reported, mistakes do happen. Appeals can be made in our Discord server.</p>
		<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">What information can this extension access?</span></h3>
		<p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px;">As can be seen in our code, which is accessible to all, the extension itself does not send us information of any kind. It simply declines trades from certain users who are flagged as bots. The only data we have regarding the extension is the amount of people who downloaded this extension, provided by Google.</p>
		<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">I'm being spammed by a bot but the extension isn't declining their trades, why?</span></h3>
		<p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px;">We have a manually compiled list of known bots due to it being near-impossible to detect them automatically. This means we will be missing some new botters, so if you want someone added to the list please join the Discord server and show us screenshots of their trades.</p>
